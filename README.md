# KEGGscape
__KEGG Database Import App for Cytoscape 3.x Series__

Formerly known as [KGMLReader](https://github.com/idekerlab/kgmlreader/tree/2.x)


Introduction
====

[Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) is a widely used bioinformatics software platform for integrating, analyzing, and visualizing biological network data sets.  KEGGscape is a [Cytoscape App](http://apps.cytoscape.org/) to provide full support for KEGG Pathway database.

About KEGG
====

[KEGG Pathway database](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) is one of the most 
comprehensive databases of human-curated biological pathways.  [KGML (KEGG Markup Language)](http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/xml/) is 
the file format to represent KEGG Pathway data files in XML.

Goals
====
Goal of this project is the following:

* Full support for [KEGG Pathway DB](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html), including signaling pathways.
* Full support for [KEGG RESTful API](http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/keggapi.html).
* Annotation by [KEGG MEDICUS database](http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/keggapi2.html)
